## About Rocket Help
This APP was built in the "Projeto Ignite Lab" from Rocket Seat. <br>
The Rocket Help App work as a manager of requests of services from the IT departament. <br>
Starts with a  login page, where only people with access permited can enter. <br>
Then, we have the page to handle the requests, if they are open or closed. And we can check on those requests, viewing the problem and at what time the request was made.<br>
<br> There's a button to finish the request, that requires offering the solution of the problem, and saves the time it was closed. <br>
And the page to make the request.
